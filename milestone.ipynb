    "The main goal of our project is to investigate the correlation of the heartrate of a chess player with various features of a match, we expect the heart rate to increase when a player has a short time remaining, we expect an higher heart rate in shorter time controls, still we are not sure how the heartrate will change in the same way after a blunder or after a brilliant move, in the same way we don't know if the person winning will have an higher rate (respect to his average rate) than the person losing, especially because the formal evaluation of a position isn't disclosed to the players. We plan to group players whose rating differs by at most 200 elo points.\n",

One of them particularly was watching a [tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXlX5dznuPA&t=15078s&ab_channel=Chess.com) where the heartrate of the players was tracked and displayed on screen and thought this could be an interesting experiment to carry out.

Then we'll try to find a good density estimation for the data (we can try to use the Gaussian model and MoG), we'll try to find the  empirical CDF and compare it with the parametric model. Other methods that we would like to use are clustering, with k-means and using the Elbow method (we'll see during the process if it will give us good results for data classification) and parametric bootstrapping for finding the pdf. For the last part of the exercise we'll use \n",
